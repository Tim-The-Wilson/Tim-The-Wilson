- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tim-The-Wilson
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, data science, data visualization, and in case you missed it, data anything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and TensorFlow. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to establish a new career in Data Science and maybe eventually database engineering.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
