### About Me: 

-  I studied Complex Dynamics in my disseration under [Mariusz UrbaÅ„ski](https://www.urbanskimath.com/) while studying at the University of North Texas.
-  But I'm really interested in data science, business analytics, and machine learning too!
-  My favorite things to write about currently include Abstract Algebra, Statistics, Business Mathematics, and German.
-  I hope to finally have my YouTube up and running this fall, I'll be posting a full undergraduate lecture series on these topics.
-  I'm excited to offer multiple pathways for both the stats and business math courses that include Python, R, and Excel lectures too.

### My Hobbies and Pastime Activities:
- ðŸ”­ I love astronomy and stargazing. I am a novice Atrsophotographer, and I hope to start posting some of my shots on Instagram.
- ðŸ§— I have been a huge fan of rock climbing for over 15 years. I am always up for a conversation on anything rock climbing, hit me up.
- ðŸ“š I can't get my fill on Sci-Fi novels and TV. My current favorite is The Expanse. I am early in the novels, but I have already watched all 6 seasons of the TV show. Yes, yes, I know, I should have read them first, but sometimes we have to make sacrifices when we have small children.
