### About Me: 

-  🎓 I am currently pursuing an MBA with a focus on Finance, shifting my career towards financial planning, wealth management, and consulting.
-  📊 My passion lies in helping individuals and families manage their finances effectively, with expertise in debt consolidation, financial planning, and wealth management strategies.
-  📈 I’m working towards becoming a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), focusing on personal financial advice, retirement planning, and tax-efficient investing.
-  💡 I enjoy using data and technology to empower clients in making informed decisions about their financial futures.
-  📺 I plan to launch my YouTube channel soon, where I’ll post educational content on personal finance, debt management, and financial planning.

### Current Projects:

- 🏦 Developing tools for individual financial planning, such as budgeting dashboards, retirement calculators, and debt consolidation strategies.
- 📘 Writing blog posts and articles on Medium and LinkedIn, sharing tips on financial planning, wealth management, and how to navigate personal finance challenges.
- 🎥 Preparing video tutorials on financial strategies, with a focus on accessible advice for individuals looking to improve their financial health.

### My Hobbies and Pastime Activities:

- 🔭 I love astronomy and stargazing. I am a novice Astrophotographer, and I post some of my shots on Instagram.
- 🏋️ I used to lift weights, and I'm trying to get back on the bandwagon again.
- 🧗 Long-time rock climber, always up for a conversation on climbing and being a gear-nerd.
- 📚 I can't get my fill on Sci-Fi novels and TV. My current favorite is The Expanse. I am early in the novels, but I have already watched all 6 seasons of the TV show. Yes, yes, I know, I should have read them first, but sometimes we have to make sacrifices when we have small children.
