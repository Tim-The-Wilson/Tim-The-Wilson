### About Me: 

-  I studied Complex Dynamics in my disseration under Mariusz UrbaÅ„ski while studying at the University of North Texas.
- Iâ€™m currently interested in data science, more specifically with fine-tuning deep neural networks and other machine learning applications.
- I've spent the last couple of months deeply investigating the TensorFlow library for Python, but now I am turning my attention to PyTorch to compare.
- I have a growing list of repositories with my certifcations and projects. Check back frequently as I'm literally making commits on the daily these days.
  - [IBM Data Science Professional Certification Repo](https://github.com/Tim-The-Wilson/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate)

### My Hobbies and Pastime Activities:
- ðŸ”­ I love astronomy and stargazing. I am a novice Atrsophotographer, and I hope to start posting some of my shots on Instagram.
- ðŸ§— I have been a huge fan of rock climbing for over 15 years. I am always up for a conversation on anything rock climbing, hit me up.
- ðŸ“š I can't get my fill on Sci-Fi novels and TV. My current favorite is The Expanse. I am early in the novels, but I have already watched all 6 seasons of the TV show. Yes, yes, I know, I should have read them first, but sometimes we have to make sacrifices when we have small children.
